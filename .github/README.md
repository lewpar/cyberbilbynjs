This is a rework of the master branch built on React + ASP.NET Core.
I tried to develop the website to replace the Hugo version using NextJS, 
however I was not liking the blurred line between client and server code.

Using ASP.NET Core as the backend also gives me the type safety I prefer and will
let me deploy my server easily compared to NextJS which is developed with Vercel in mind.
